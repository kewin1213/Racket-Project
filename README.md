# Racket-Project
My semester 1 Racket Project.
In this project we were tasked to create a problem and solve it using different codes and ideas.
My idea was to convert kilojoules(KJ) to calories(KCAL). 
It also involved a list that converted the whole list.
The comments explain the ideas behind each code line.
